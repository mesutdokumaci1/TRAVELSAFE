Last Updated: January 25, 2026

TravelSafe ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

1. Information We Access
Our app requires access to certain features of your device to function correctly. We do NOT collect or store this data on our servers; it is processed locally on your device.

Camera: Used solely for visual glint detection and AI analysis to identify hidden camera lenses. No photos or videos are recorded, saved, or transmitted.
Bluetooth: Used to scan for nearby tracking devices (like AirTags or unknown beacons) to ensure your privacy from physical tracking.
Local Network: Used to scan your Wi-Fi network for suspicious connected devices, such as hidden IP cameras.
Location: We may request location access to identify the Wi-Fi network name (SSID), which is required by iOS for network scanning.
2. Third-Party Services
We use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:

Google AdMob: Used to display advertisements. AdMob may collect device identifiers (IDFA) to provide personalized ads. You can manage this in your device settings.
MacVendors API: Used to identify the manufacturer of devices found on your network. Only the MAC address prefix (first 6 characters) is sent to this API.
3. Data Storage
We do not have a backend server. All scan results and app data remain on your physical device. If you delete the app, all associated data is removed.

4. Children’s Privacy
Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
